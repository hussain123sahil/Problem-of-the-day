# Daily Coding Challenges Repository

Welcome to my Daily Coding Challenges repository! Here, I will be uploading solutions to the **Problem of the Day (POTD)** from [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) and the **Daily Coding Challenge (DCC)** from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) every day.

## Structure

The repository is organized by date, with each date having its own directory. Inside each date directory, you will find:
- `potd_gfg.cpp`: Solution for the GeeksforGeeks Problem of the Day.
- `dcc_leetcode.cpp`: Solution for the LeetCode Daily Coding Challenge.

Each date directory is named in the `DDth_month` format.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the directory corresponding to the date you're interested in.
2. Open the `potd_gfg.cpp` file to see the solution for the GeeksforGeeks POTD.
3. Open the `dcc_leetcode.cpp` file to see the solution for the LeetCode DCC.
